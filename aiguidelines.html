<h2 data-heading="Why?" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Why?</h2>
<p1 data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">It is currently June 2023. It has been roughly 8 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT for general public use, and the number of AI services, websites, APIs, and marketing has grown more quickly than any other advance in technology (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/" target="_blank">see ChatGPT's growth to 100m user in just 2 months; TikTok 9, Instagram 2.5</a>). As such, it is unpredictable how integrated AI will be in our lives even 6 months from now at Christmastime 2023. </p>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Therefore, all usage of AI in my personal writings must be clearly delineated until further notice. Every use of AI here is experimental, and so I want to quarantine it from my own writings in case my stuff is read 2, 5, 10, or 20 years from now.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Guidelines" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Guidelines</h2>
<h3 data-heading="Mandatory Until Further Notice" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Mandatory Until Further Notice</h3>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">All AI-generated content must be clearly distinguished as such. The current convention is to use <mark>BEGIN AI-INTERSPERSED CONTENT</mark> and <mark>END AI-INTERSPERSED CONTENT</mark> as needed to make clear that the writing in between may not be human written.</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">When recording prompts and responses ("conversations") with AI, distinguish between the prompt as written by the user and the response as returned by the AI.</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-heading="Conventions and Best Practices" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Conventions and Best Practices</h3>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">If editing the response as written by the AI to use elsewhere, make clear that the response text is no longer verbatim. You do not have to make clear <em>where</em> the text is no longer verbatim, just that it <em>is</em>.
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">It is recommended to still record both the verbatim response by the AI <em>and</em> the edited response separately, so in the future one can compare the two. For science.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Distinguish between different kinds of AI-involvement by using the following terms:
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>AI-Generated Content</mark> 
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">ANY content of which the AI response is the source. All AI reponses fall under "AI Generated Content". This label would be used when the content is wholly AI response.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>AI-Incepted Content</mark>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"AI-Incepted" means the content is an AI response, but the prompt is not known or not relevant. E.g., using an AI-generated picture found online, without knowing the prompt that was used.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>AI-Interspersed Content</mark>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"AI-Interspersed" means that both the user's prompts and the AI responses are recorded, and clearly distinguished in the content. E.g. having a conversation with AI and recording both the user's prompts and the AI responses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>AI-Augmented Content</mark>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"AI-Augmented" means that the user prompt is asking the AI to modify the content of the prompt, and the AI response is the user's content modified as prompted. E.g. Asking AI to act as an editor, or to rewrite prose or bullet points into a different tone or style, without including the prompt or the original human writing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">See below for an example of a conversation recorded.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Conversation with ChatGPT 2023-06-06" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Conversation with ChatGPT 2023-06-06</h2>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">AI: <span class="internal-link">ChatGPT May 24 Version</span></p>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>BEGIN AI-INTERSPERSED CONTENT</mark></p>
<h3 data-heading="1. Corey" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">1. Corey</h3>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Hi ChatGPT, you are a thesaurus.</p>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">What's a good word to use for a "delimiter" of sorts in text files I write that has AI content in it, as a disclosure? I started with "Begin AI-Generated Content" and "End AI-Generated Content" but I don't like it because the document section includes the whole conversation between user and AI. " Begin AI-Affiliated Content"  and "End AI-Affiliated Content" is closer to what I want, but doesn't sound right. What three suggestions do you have? Explain your reasoning for each option.</p>
<h3 data-heading="1. ChatGPT" data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">1. ChatGPT</h3>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Certainly! Here are three alternative suggestions for a word to use as a delimiter for AI-generated content in your text files:</p>
<ol>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"Incept": Reasoning: "Incept" is a term associated with the beginning or initiation of something. It implies the start of the AI-generated content section in your document. It has a futuristic and technical connotation, which can be suitable for signaling the presence of AI involvement.</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"Intersperse": Reasoning: "Intersperse" means to scatter or distribute among other things. By using "Intersperse AI Content" as your delimiter, you convey the idea that the AI-generated content is integrated within the larger conversation. It suggests that the AI's responses are seamlessly blended with the user's input.</li>
<li data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">"Augmented": Reasoning: "Augmented" refers to enhancing or supplementing something with additional elements. By using "Augmented Content," you emphasize that the AI's contributions are an augmentation to the user's original text. It implies that the AI's responses are meant to complement and enrich the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1">Remember, the choice of delimiter is subjective, and you should select the one that best fits your context and desired tone. These suggestions aim to provide alternatives that convey the involvement of AI in a clear and descriptive manner.</p>
<p data-rve-block="true" tabindex="-1"><mark>END AI-INTERSPERSED CONTENT</mark></p></div>
