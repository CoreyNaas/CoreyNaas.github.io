This is my decentralized MySpace for neocities. Created by Joe Bliven:
joejoefashosho.neocities.org

To add a myspace page to your neocities site:

1. On your neocities site create a new folder and name it "myspace" (without the quotation marks)
2. In the "myspace" folder upload the "myspace.css" file, the "index.html" file, and the "img" folder
3. Now visit (YourUserNameHere).neocities.org/myspace and voila! you'll see a profile for Joe Bliven

To edit your profile, simply open the index.html file in a text editor 
(or the built-in editor on neocities). Replace all of the details with your own, 
just make sure that you leave your details inside the quotation marks and make 
sure each response stays on one line. If you hit the return key in the middle of a response, 
the page won't load properly. The about me section is the last custimization option. The about me
section is also where you can paste custom code like layouts from pimp-my-profile.com
