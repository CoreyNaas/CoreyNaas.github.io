            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 15th, 2018</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully it&rsquo;s not just me who's had this train of thoughts: You meet somebody of the gender you&rsquo;re generally attracted to, and you have a quick thought of &ldquo;Am I interested in this person?&rdquo; Now, you just met them, so you&rsquo;re not working with much, but it&rsquo;s just something that happens every so often. You start talking to them, getting to know their personality, and such, and perhaps your initial opinion changes. Perhaps you learn that they&rsquo;re interested in the same things, and so again you ask yourself &ldquo;Am I interested in this person? Could I see myself with them at all?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to take these quick thoughts and use it as the beginning of three relationship stages: The &ldquo;Could I&rdquo; stage, the &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; stage, and the &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; stage.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could I.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Could I?&rdquo; is completely hypothetical, and absolutely judgemental. I like to use the phrase &ldquo;We have to start somewhere&rdquo; to justify it, but it really shouldn&rsquo;t need justification. It&rsquo;s just instinct. Its full manifestation is most commonly in the forms of &ldquo;Could I like this person? Could I admit to somebody (or myself, or even this person) that I like this person? Could I see myself being intimate with this person? &ldquo;Could I see myself saying &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; to them?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s completely noncommittal, and that&rsquo;s what makes it key to the &ldquo;Could I&rdquo; stage.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Friendships live here. For some friends this thought may never cross your mind, while for other friends you might ask yourself every time you talk to them.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you&rsquo;re introduced to someone&rsquo;s friend.at first you think they&rsquo;re cute or handsome, and so you ask yourself &ldquo;could I like this person?&rdquo;, and you say yes, of course. But after talking to them for a bit you realize that they&rsquo;re an insufferable moron and so you ask yourself again and now the answer is no. Likewise, you&rsquo;re introduced to someone who is not attractive to you, and so your initial answer is no, but as you get to talk to them your realize that you two have a lot in common and get along well together, so your opinion of them changes and so does your answer to &ldquo;could I like this person? Could I see myself in a relationship with them? Could I see myself saying &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; to them, perhaps?&rdquo; That last one is a bit of a stretch, but I hope I&rsquo;m not the only one that imagines a lifetime with someone after knowing them for two seconds. Or no seconds, if you&rsquo;ve never talked to them.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; is something that is asked almost constantly in an active romantic relationship. Its full manifestation is most commonly in the forms of &ldquo;Can I commit to this person? Can I overlook this flaw, difference, or conviction? Can I continue to look past these? Can I tell this person &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; despite their shortcomings? Can I continue to see myself with them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I see myself with this person for the next 60 years?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, You did your go/no go on the &ldquo;Could I&rdquo; with a girl, and she&rsquo;s done the same with you, and now you&rsquo;re in a relationship. A week in, you&rsquo;re talking about animals, and she mentions that she despises cats. Like, doesn&rsquo;t even like seeing their pictures on facebook, which makes you instinctively close your facebook tab, because you love cats. Like, &ldquo;I would love to retire with 60 cats&rdquo; level of love. So now you have to do a good ole&rsquo; Can I: &ldquo;Can I tell this girl I love here, even though I love cats and she hates cats? Can I continue a relationship with this girl even though I really want 30 cats when I&rsquo;m older, and she wants... not 30 cats?&rdquo; These types of questions are &ldquo;Could I&rdquo; questions, because if the answer is ever no you&rsquo;ll have to then ask yourself how important the difference at hand is to you. It&rsquo;s an active, committed thought. It&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re constantly asking yourself in a relationship, because it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;make or break&rdquo; question.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will I.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; is the question that you have to ask yourself only after a decent amount of time in a relationship. &ldquo;will I&rdquo; is when you ask yourself &ldquo;Will I commit to this? Will I commit to all of these perceived shortcomings, all of the things we disagree on? Will I commit to saying &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; for the next 60-some-odd years? Will I commit to him/her?&rdquo; Will I is a decision that demands an action. If you ask yourself &ldquo;will I&rdquo;, and you answer yes, then at that point you should probably propose. If you ask yourself &ldquo;will I&rdquo; and you answer no, then you probably need to end the relationship. Most of the time, however, the answer will be &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;Insufficient data for meaningful answer.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will I is not a hypothetical, like &ldquo;Could I&rdquo;, nor is it a constant affirmation of the possible permanence of a relationship, as &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; is. &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; is a question that is asked a few dozen times and answered once. It is definitive, final, a commitment.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Will I&rdquo; is permanent. Except when it&rsquo;s not. Divorce is obviously a thing that happens, but hopefully both of you would have asked &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; enough before answering &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; that you know exactly what you&rsquo;re committing to. &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t have to be rescinded because one or both of you didn&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; enough, or didn&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; about the right subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a visual exercise, I&rsquo;d like to think about the progression of a relationship in the context of &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; as what starts off as a blank sheet of paper. As you go through this relationship, you start to ask those &ldquo;Can I&rdquo; questions, and with each answer, you draw a few lines on the paper and fill it in with a colour: Green for &ldquo;I can&rdquo;, yellow for &ldquo;eh&rdquo;, and red for &ldquo;I cannot&rdquo;. The size of the area that you fill in reflects how important that particular answer is for you: a large section might represent their religious views, while a tiny section might reflect where they put bowls in the dishwasher (they go on the top, obviously). If a tiny section is red, you can probably get past that, but the larger a section that isn&rsquo;t green is, the more you should think about what your answer to &ldquo;Will I&rdquo; might be.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the paper gets more and more filled in, you start to see the bigger picture. Once a large portion is full, you can start to consider asking yourself &ldquo;Will I?&rdquo;</span></p>
