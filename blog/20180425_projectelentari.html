            <p>Back in February, when our group project for Spacecraft Design was just getting off the ground, I put on my dusty Ushanka of Creativity one weekend and wrote up this mission proposal. There were some changes made to the proposal as time went on and we figured out what exactly we wanted to do, but most of my ideas were actualized in the end, most notably the name. I&rsquo;m really proud of how this little piece of imaginative science fiction turned out, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
