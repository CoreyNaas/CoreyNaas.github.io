      <m1>Letter from a Birmingham Jail.</m1><br>
        <p1>
            <!-- Main Post Text Goes Here! -->
            <p><i>This post was originally published on coreyscottnaas.wordpress.com on 15 January 2019.</i></p>
            <p>I just read Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letter From a Birmingham Jail&rdquo; all the way through for the first time, and it&rsquo;s amazing to me at how much of what MLK wrote fifty years ago can still be applied today. What follows are some of my favourite passages. I tried to keep it concise, but it&rsquo;s hard to not just quote entire paragraphs. Bold and italics are my own emphasis on passages that I particularly like.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.<em>&nbsp;We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.</em>&nbsp;Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial &ldquo;outside agitator&rdquo; idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You may well ask: &ldquo;Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn&rsquo;t negotiation a better path?&rdquo; You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action.<em>&nbsp;Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.</em>&nbsp;My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word &ldquo;tension.&rdquo; I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.&nbsp;<em>The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation.</em>&nbsp;Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&nbsp;<em>Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was &ldquo;well timed&rdquo; in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.</em>&nbsp;For years now I have heard the word &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This &ldquo;Wait&rdquo; has almost always meant &ldquo;Never.&rdquo; We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;justice too long delayed is justice denied.&rdquo;</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.<strong>&nbsp;First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner,<em>&nbsp;but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &ldquo;order&rdquo; than to justice</em>; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;</em>;</strong>&nbsp;who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.&nbsp;<em>Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</em></strong><br />I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.&nbsp;<em>Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: &ldquo;All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.&rdquo; Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.&nbsp;<strong><em>We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.</em>&nbsp;We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so.<em>&nbsp;If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history.</em>&nbsp;So I have not said to my people: &ldquo;Get rid of your discontent.&rdquo; Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.&nbsp;<strong>Was not Jesus an extremist for love: &ldquo;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;Was not Amos an extremist for justice: &ldquo;Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.&rdquo; Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: &ldquo;I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Was not Martin Luther an extremist: &ldquo;Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.&rdquo; And John Bunyan: &ldquo;I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.&rdquo; And Abraham Lincoln: &ldquo;This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.&rdquo; And Thomas Jefferson: &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?</strong>&nbsp;In that dramatic scene on Calvary&rsquo;s hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime&ndash;the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much.<em>&nbsp;I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action.</em>&nbsp;I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some -such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle&ndash;have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as &ldquo;dirty nigger-lovers.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful &ldquo;action&rdquo; antidotes to combat the disease of segregation</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;preventing violence.&rdquo; I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.&rdquo;</p>
