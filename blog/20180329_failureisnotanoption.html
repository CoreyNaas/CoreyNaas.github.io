            <p>Just a quick thing I wrote down while reading Gene Kranz&rsquo; book Failure is Not an Option:</p>
            <p>You have to be completely selfless if you&rsquo;re going to lead a team, especially if the team you lead is smarter/knows more about specific things than you do. You have to be willing to learn, and you absolutely have to be able to accept that someone else has the right solution to a problem. When things go right, you need to be able to give credit where credit is due, and when things go wrong, you have to be tough enough to accept the blame.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;High-risk leadership beckons many, but few accept the call.&rdquo; I would add that I think of the few that accept that call, fewer still are qualified to accept it, but those few that are tough enough to accept the call, and qualified enough to keep it, are the ones that make the impossible not only possible, but accomplished. Whether or not they get into the history books, they understand that it takes a village to teach, and it takes a team to learn, but it takes an individual to master.</p>
