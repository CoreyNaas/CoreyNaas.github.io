            <h1>Name</h1>
            Quincy. I like the letter Q. I don't think it's used as much as it could be. Though since there's at least two letters that do as much as Q does and even more sometimes, it's not as useful as it should be. I also prefer my letters free of conspiracy theories.
            <h1>Responsibilities</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Routing and switching WAN <-> LAN traffic (between Quincy's guests and the internet)</li>
                <li>Routing and switching LAN <-> LAN traffic (between Quincy's guests and themselves)</li>
                <li>Hosting my Home Assistant</li>
                <li>Hosting my qBox multi-purpose server</li>
                <li>Hosting my future media server</li>
                <li>Hosting my future Grand Unified Data Fishing Hole (GRUDFH)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>qBox</h2>
                qBox will still be the name of the primary lab server accessible through Quincy, but the over-arching network infrastructure will be referred to by Quincy.
