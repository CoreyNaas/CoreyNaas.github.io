            <p>Whelp, I&rsquo;ve done it. I&rsquo;ve gone and made a &ldquo;country music&rdquo; playlist. The times surely are a changin&rsquo;. What&rsquo;s next, cowboy boots and belt buckles?? (well&hellip;)</p>
            <p>I have a bad habit of becoming super interested in something and spending the next two weeks or so obsessively interested learning everything I can about said thing. Last week, it was flying, thanks to the release of Microsoft Flight Sim 2020. This week, it&rsquo;s country music.</p>
            <p>I decided that I finally needed to get a little bit closer in my quest of listening to all the music in the world and add some country music to my collection. I&rsquo;ve added one or two Dolly Parton and George Strait song in my collection over the years, but have never taken a serious deep dive into country music as a whole.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, I listened to the podcast Dolly Parton&rsquo;s America and added some of her stuff to my collection. For country music in general, a few weeks ago I found out that Ken Burns released a 16-hour documentary last year. How convenient! It took more than a few days to get through, because as much as I love music and documentaries, I can only take so much &ldquo;narrated slideshow&rdquo; before getting distracted by something else. The documentary covers the beginning of the genre all the way up to 1996 or so. For more contemporary country music, I found Grady Smith&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2KWMMkU5ic">subgenre primer</a> video to be a pretty helpful jumping-off point.</p>
            <p>Some of my current favorite new discoveries are &ldquo;Wagon Wheel&rdquo; by Old Crow Medicine Show, &ldquo;Down in the Arkansas&rdquo; by Jimmy Driftwood, &ldquo;A Life Where We Work Out&rdquo; by Flatland Cavalry, &ldquo;Biscuits&rdquo; by Kacey Musgraves, and &ldquo;Coal Miner&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; by Loretta Lynn.</p>
            <p>As always, recommendations and suggestions are much appreciated. Cover image is &ldquo;The Music Man&rdquo; by Norman Rockwell.</p>
