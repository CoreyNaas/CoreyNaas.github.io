            <p>Whelp, I&rsquo;m a little late on this one. Better late than never I guess. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been watching and listening to this week. It&rsquo;s a little light because I&rsquo;m currently engrossed in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.<span id="more-862"></span></p>

            <li>&ldquo;President Richard Nixon once boasted that at any moment he could pick up a telephone and &ndash; in 20 minutes &ndash; kill 60 million people. Such is the power of the US President over the nation&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal. But what if you were the military officer on the receiving end of that phone call? Could you refuse the order?&rdquo;</li>

            <li>&ldquo;The official podcast of the miniseries Chernobyl, from HBO and Sky. Join host Peter Sagal (NPR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wait Wait&hellip;Don&rsquo;t Tell Me!&rdquo;) and series creator, writer and executive producer Craig Mazin after each episode as they discuss the true stories that shaped the scenes, themes and characters.&rdquo;</li>

            <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve taken part in a religious service, have you ever stopped to think about how it all came to be? How did people become believers? Where did the rituals come from? And most of all, what purpose does it all serve? This week, we explore these questions with psychologist Azim Shariff, who argues that we can think of religion from a Darwinian perspective, as an innovation that helped human societies to survive and flourish.&rdquo;</li>

            <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;This describes the operation explaining friction stoppage by compressed gas pressing on a piston to apply the force to the pads required to stop a moving vehicle.&rdquo;</li>

            <ul>
            <li>After going to a Synagogue this Saturday, I realized that I actually attended a Reform Judaism Synagogue. I didn&rsquo;t even realize there were different kinds of Judaism. I watched this short video to get a quick understanding of where Reform Judaism came from, and the basic differences between it and Orthodox Judaism.</li>

            <li>misteramazing:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Ypgi9Q8PcW4">The Classic YouTube Experience</a>
            <ul>
            <li>A more traditional video essay in which a YouTuber reminisces about the &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; YouTube experience of the late 00&rsquo;s and early 10&rsquo;s where the algorithms actually showed you videos related to the one you&rsquo;re watching, and showed you videos from not mega-popular videos, allowing truly homegrown and authentically amateur content to thrive. Think about it: When&rsquo;s the last time you &ldquo;stumbled&rdquo; onto a small YouTube channel, from YouTube?</li>
