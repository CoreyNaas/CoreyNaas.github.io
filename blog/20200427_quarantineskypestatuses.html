            <p><i>This post was originally published on coreyscottnaas.wordpress.com on 27 April 2020.</i></p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been working from home for over a month now, and the first few weeks I updated my work Skype statuses daily. Here are some of the better ones.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>At home, nobody knows how messy your desk is</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <i><p>Not suggesting that my desk at work was any cleaner, but at least I can pretend my home desk is clean.</p></i>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the conference calls.</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Gatsby believed in the green light, but not the &ldquo;Join Call&rdquo; button.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>At home, nobody can complain about the volume of your *CLACK*k*CLACK*e*CLACK*y*CLACK*b*CLACK*o*CLACK*a*CLACK*r*CLACK*d*CLACK*</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It really is a loud keyboard.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>♫ Ooh you can dance, just stay inside, having the time of your life / Ooh write that code, make that screen, digging the quarantine&nbsp; ♫</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Never a bad time for ABBA.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>Don&rsquo;t point at the screen during a conference call</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I might have done this once or twice, but I&rsquo;ll never admit it.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>What did the dad say to his disobedient son who went and did what his dad just punished him for? &ldquo;Whelp,&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aaMMg43rh9cbarEu8">https://goo.gl/maps/aaMMg43rh9cbarEu8</a>&ldquo;</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Probably the stupidest pun I&rsquo;ve ever thought of.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>XIC RedBull OTE Productivity</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>PLC programming puns. Basically &ldquo;IF RedBull THEN Productivity&rdquo;.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>♫ My gift is my rung, and this one&rsquo;s for you / And you can tell everybody, this is your rung / it may by quite simple but, now that XICs done / I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, that I put down in MOVs / how wonderful scans are, while you&rsquo;re in the world ♫</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>More PLC puns. Sorry. Also, I prefer the Ewan Mcgregor version to the original. I stand by this.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>♫ If you change your mind, I&rsquo;m the first in line / Honey, I&rsquo;m still free, Hit me up on Teams / If you need me, let me know, Gonna be around / If you&rsquo;ve got no place to go, If your code is down ♫</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Again, never a bad time for ABBA.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <i><p>Two projects, both alike in dignity,<br />In fair Integra, where we lay our scene,<br />From ancient code break to new developing,<br />Where civil teams make civil conference calls unclean.<br />From forth the fatal Skypes of these two foes,<br />a pair of star-crossed inovees takes their laptop&rsquo;s life;<br />whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br />do with their laptops&rsquo; death bury their teammate&rsquo;s strife.<br />The fearful passage of their BSOD mark&rsquo;d screens,<br />And the continuance of their teammate&rsquo;s rage,<br />which but their coder&rsquo;s end nought could remove<br />is now the two hour&rsquo;s traffic of our stage.<br />The which if you with patient ears attend<br />what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p></i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And finally, my Magnum Opus. Somehow making Shakespeare nerdier than it already was.</p>
