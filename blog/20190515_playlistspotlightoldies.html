            <div class="post-thumbnail">I love old music. I spent the Summer of 2017 working in LeTourneau&rsquo;s carpentry shop, and they had one of those cool DeWalt construction radios that ran on DeWalt tool batteries, and I took that thing&nbsp;<em>everywhere.&nbsp;</em>I literally just asked one of my friends (who I worked with in carpentry before we were really friends) about the accuracy of that statement and she said &ldquo;very.&rdquo; Anyway, the station that came through the best was East Texas&rsquo; very own 101.9 KDOK, which played all the best songs from the 60&rsquo;s, 70&rsquo;s, and 80&rsquo;s (less often we&rsquo;d listen to their sister station, QXFM, but they played even older stuff so I preferred KDOK). The thing I really liked about KDOK, and what makes it my favourite radio station even today, though I don&rsquo;t listen to it any more, is that they didn&rsquo;t just play the top 1,000 hits of the day. I constantly was hearing songs I&rsquo;d never heard before (and I&rsquo;d already had good exposure to old music through years of Pandora). The ad were also few and far between. It was a true home-grown station.</div>
            <p>Anyway, since then I&rsquo;ve kept a playlist of my favourite &ldquo;Oldies&rdquo;, which are loosely defined as songs that came out before I was born. I&rsquo;ve added to it continously, as I&rsquo;ve watched and re-watched period shows like Mad Men and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (have I mentioned how much I&nbsp;<em>looove</em>&nbsp;period pieces?).</p>
            <p>The playlist is in no particular order, so shuffling is encouraged. Enjoy!</p>
