			<m1>Welcome!</m1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="color: black;">Welcome to my blog! This is a good old-fashioned hand-crafted website. No flashy graphics, no SEO, analytics or ads, and no pre-made templates. Just me, some code I learned when I was 12, and whatever thoughts decide to populate my brain. Enjoy!</p>
				</li>
                <li>
                    <p style="color: black;">I started this website in April 2023, and I chose to handwrite it because with the opening-of-access to AI and the innovative ways we come up with to use it, "perfect" content is always achievable now on with no more than the slightest of effort. Why write uniquely when you can have the AI write "correctly"? I'd like to have my corner of the internet be handmade in a way that shows, including in the imperfections. I proofread, but generally won't use a spellchecker; if I miss it I miss it. <em>Kintsugi</em> in website form.</p>

                    I'm still alive! Not to worry. I'm employed again and the Sabbatical was a huge success. Details to come... later. Eventually.

                    Not <i>already</i>. <i>Also</i>. Someone on the internet has <i>also</i> had the idea you just had and looked up; they didn't <i>"already"</i> have it, as if once something becomes "Google"-able you're too late. Keep thinkin' what you're thinkin', and see where it leads.

                    Been listening to a ton of classical music lately, according to Last.fm. I think my favourite piece so far as been <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsvL2poCHug&pp=ygUSZmFrZSBwbGFzdGljIHRyZWVz">falsche Plastikb√§ume in D Major, Op. 16: I.

                    Added a surprise book to my reading list for October: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617802/disability-visibility-by-alice-wong/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617802/disability-visibility-by-alice-wong/" target="_blank">Disability Visibility</a>, a collection of first-person stories about the disabled experience. My city, Tempe, is hosting <em><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.tempepubliclibrary.org/event-calendar/one-tempe-one-book" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.tempepubliclibrary.org/event-calendar/one-tempe-one-book" target="_blank">One Tempe One Book</a></em>, a community read in October for this book, with various discussions and events surrounding disability awareness also happening thoughout the month. &para; I'm excited to expand my worldview <em>and</em> discuss it with my local community, comparing our experiences. I've been fortunate to live a life where I can move how I want, love who I want, and in general be treated well and fair. There's blinders on my eyes that I didn't put there, but they are there regardless, and thus my responsibility to remove. Fortunately, learning awareness in anything new is always easy, because it's always the same: just listen.

                    Reading <a href="https://nutcroft.com/blog/on-satoshi/">On Satoshi - nutcroft</a>, published in 2018, and this line stuck out to me: &para; "Regardless, according to that birthdate, Satoshi would be 34 years old in 2009. His masterful knowledge of C++, cryptography and distributed concepts reveal only part of his genius. What he managed via Bitcoin is the use of existing technologies in such a way that he created something so radical that changed the journey of current technology. Everybody in tech now talks about blockchain. The reason is the work of one person. He devoted <em>only</em> 2 years of his life for this." &para; Literally all of capital-C Crypto nowadays started with Bitcoin in 2008. I first learned about it in early 2013, a mere five years after it was developed. <em>that</em> was 10 years ago. Time flies.

                    I'm basically "Matrixifying" (pronounced "<b>Mah</b>-<em>trix</em>-i<b>fy</b>ing") myself as I get deep into "plain text" this, and "plain text" that. I'm training myself to see the everything in terms of data structures and operations on that data. First my notes, then my tasks, then my schedule, and now my finances. <em>all</em> my finances. All in two days. I didn't have to figure it out myself, try and make sure I get all the edge cases; Someone else already did. I just have to follow the templates. In Obsidian!

                   Corey a few days ago: "I should set up a budget again". Corey now: "Whelp I'm fully converted over to a plain-text double-entry accounting system that I can open and edit in Obsidian." I almost forgot the budget part!
